This file contains some unknown items from the source scripts. Unknown items are data that
cannot be extracted from the compiled fastfiles, such as:
- Preprocessor directives
- Macros
- Debug strings
- Identifiers
- Compile-time hashed strings
- Comments

Usually, if an item in a script is unknown, I don't add it to this repository until I can
verify what the item is, but in some cases, there will be a reasonable certainty of what
the item is, and the item will have a low importance and low effect on the overall script
that it is worthwhile to include the script despite the lack of absolute certainty.

----------------

- DEBUGSTRING
  scripts/shared/animation_shared.gsc: Unknown debug strings in debug_print().
    What these strings probably are is clear given the lengths of the strings, which are known,
    but I cannot technically verify them to be what they are at this time. The strings I put in
    that file in place of them are certainly the same length as the original dev strings, and
    given the context and the patterns observed in other source files, I'm fairly certain those
    are the correct strings.

----------------

- MACRO
  scripts/zm/_zm_bot.gsc: Unknown macro definitions at start of file.
    The 'must match code' comment and the several empty lines below it suggest that there are
    some macro definitions there, probably 4 or 5 definitions that don't seem to be used
    anywhere in the source. I'm not sure what they could be, but the C header file that they
    are supposed to match is given (hkai_influence.h).
