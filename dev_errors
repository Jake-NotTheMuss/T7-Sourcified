This file contains a record of mostly trivial mistakes left over by the developers. Since these
mistakes will be corrected in the re-sourcification, I want to log them somewhere.

Mistakes can be of the following types:
- Misspelling in debug strings or comments (SPELLING)
- An oversight by the developers (OVERSIGHT) (see entries of this type for examples)

----------------

- SPELLING
  scripts/codescripts/delete.csc: In main() at line 15
    Forgot to change '.gsc' to'.csc' in the string passed to println()
    (This is also the case in the T6 version of delete.csc.)

----------------

- OVERSIGHT
  scripts/zm/_zm_devgui.gsc: in function zombie_devgui_allow_fog()
    The fog Dvars are restored but the cull distance is not restored.
    The function disable_fog_in_noclip() watches for when any player goes into noclip mode,
    and disables fog and sets cull distance to zero while any player is in noclip mode. Then,
    once no players are in noclip mode, fog and cull distance are restored to their original
    values. zombie_devgui_allow_fog() kills the disable_fog_in_noclip() thread, and then
    restores the fog as needed, but the cull distance is not restored.
